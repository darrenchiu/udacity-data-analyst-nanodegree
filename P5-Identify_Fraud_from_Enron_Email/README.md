# P5-Identify_Fraud_from_Enron_Email
## Files Explanation
All the code related files are under the folder `final_project`
* `my_classifier.pkl`, my_dataset.pkl, my_feature_list.pkl - the output from poi_id.py
* `poi_id.py` - final code for submission
* `Enron_Data_exploration.ipynb` - All the wraggling on the data and process of experimenting with the machine learning algorithms are stored in this jupyter notebook. It serves as a record of stuff that I tried and some notes throughout the process. It was not intended to be use as documentation but a reference of the thought process.

There is also a `Project_Report.pdf` at root of this folder, for satisfying the project requirements and documentations.
